Michael Bayer is a NYC-based software contractor with a decade of
experience dealing with relational databases of all shapes and sizes.
After writing many homegrown database abstraction layers in such
languages as C, Java and Perl, and finally after several years of
practice working with a huge multi-server Oracle system for Major
League Baseball, he wrote SQLAlchemy as the 'ultimate toolset' for
generating SQL and dealing with databases overall. The goal is to
contribute towards a world-class one-of-a-kind toolset for Python,
helping to make Python the universally popular programming platform it
deserves to be.
